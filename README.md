Hello everyone, 
  As per the task, I followed every steps, there is a search box(Edit text) that sends the artist's name to ViewModel. I followed android architecture, used MVVM, data binding, retrofit, and room database. This task is fully written in Kotlin language as per the instructions. Apart from them, I make sure whenever the device got disconnected it fetches data from the room database. As written in the task, a Unit test is a Brownie point, I implemented it but as it is not a product for the production I did not create many tests.
  Thank you I hope you like my work, and I got this lifetime opportunity to be in your team.
